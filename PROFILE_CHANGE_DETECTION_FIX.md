/**
 * MyStudyAbroadPath Fix Instructions
 * 
 * The issue is that the profile in MyStudyAbroadPath is being updated every time the component 
 * mounts, not only when preferences in the profile change.
 * 
 * To fix this issue:
 * 
 * 1. Add the pathwayUpdateDetector utility to your import statements:
 *    ```
 *    import { generateProfileHash, shouldUpdatePathway, ONLY_UPDATE_ON_PROFILE_CHANGE } 
 *      from '../../utils/pathwayUpdateDetector';
 *    ```
 * 
 * 2. Add a profileHash state variable if not already present:
 *    ```
 *    const [profileHash, setProfileHash] = useState(null);
 *    ```
 * 
 * 3. Modify loadUserProfile and loadExistingPathway to check for profile changes:
 *    - In loadUserProfile, get the current profile hash
 *    - Check if it has changed using shouldUpdatePathway(profile, profileHash)
 *    - Only call loadExistingPathway with forceRefresh=true when profile has changed
 *    - Otherwise call loadExistingPathway with forceRefresh=false
 *    - Update the profileHash after processing
 * 
 * 4. In loadExistingPathway, only check for updates when forceRefresh is true
 *    - When forceRefresh is true, show "Your pathway has been updated based on your profile changes!"
 *    - When forceRefresh is false, show "Your saved study abroad pathway has been loaded."
 * 
 * This approach ensures we only update pathways when relevant profile preferences actually change,
 * avoiding unnecessary refreshes that could lead to duplicate data or confusing messages.
